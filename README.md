# Overview

This web app is a personal portfolio website built with React and Vite. The goal of this project is to practice front-end development, UI/UX design, and dynamic web functionality while improving my skills as a software engineer.

The application showcases a portfolio with sections for Home and About Me, with additional pages for Services and Contact currently under construction. Users can navigate between pages using smooth scrolling, and it features a dark/light mode toggle as well as interactive buttons.

The purpose of writing this software is to enhance my front-end development skills, practice responsive UI design, and learn deployment with GitHub Pages.

# Web Pages

* Home: The landing page with an introduction and links to other sections.
* About Me: Displays a personal bio, skills, and experience.
* Services: Currently under construction. Once implemented, this page will display the services I can offer.
* Contact: Currently under construction. Once implemented, this page will include a contact form for users to get in touch.

Navigation between pages is smooth via scrolling. The dark/light mode toggle updates the theme across all pages. Buttons are interactive and styled with dynamic hover effects.

# Development Environment

* Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub, Vite
* Programming Language: JavaScript (ES6+)
* Libraries: React, react-router-dom (for routing), gh-pages (for deployment)
